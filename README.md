## Brewlette

Brewlette was born from a discussion amongst friends of the decision paralysis that comes from finding / choosing a cafe to work from in New York City. The app currently allows you to select a neighborhood, and a random cafe in that neighborhood will be chosen for you.

## Design

Brewlette was created in collaboration with amysit94@gmail.com, who designed and branded the app.
